The sun dips low, a golden hue,
Painting the sky in shades anew.
Silhouettes dance on the breeze,
As leaves whisper through the trees.
A lone bird calls, a haunting song,
As twilight lingers, soft and long.
Stars begin to softly gleam,
A world hushed, a peaceful dream.
This poem captures the beauty of a sunset, with its changing colors, quiet sounds, and the onset of night.
